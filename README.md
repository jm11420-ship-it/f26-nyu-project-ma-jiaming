# Student Reminder

## Mockups

[Latest mockups: Assignment 4 - Simple](https://www.figma.com/design/0SoEjWDAEfPn7mrhA9K1r1/JiamingMa_LandingPage?node-id=15-412)

The webpage now adds an upcoming-reminders list below the form. The saved and reminder states are still displayed as examples on the same page.

## Weekly update - October 25, 2026

- Added five reminders generated with JavaScript. Each shows an event name, date, time, and priority.
- Kept the existing colors, fonts, and spacing.
- Challenge: keeping the generated content consistent with the existing page. The new items use the same heading font and simple separators.
- Open question: how many reminders should Medium priority send?
- Next week: plan how the Save reminder button will add a new event to the list.

## Data and HTML generation

The `reminders` array contains five example student events. Each object has `title`, `date`, `time`, and `priority`, matching the information in the form. The dates are demonstration data, not an actual class schedule.

`script.js` finds the `reminder-list` container. A `forEach` loop processes every reminder in order; an index is not needed. For each item, `document.createElement()` creates an article, heading, time element, and paragraphs. `textContent` fills in the text, and `appendChild()` adds the elements to the page. Adding another object to the array produces another item without copying HTML.
